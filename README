PaperClip Example
================

This is just a quick and dirty example of how to use paperclip plugin by thoughtbot I'm using Rails 2.3.1 for this example but anything 2.0+ should be fine

Install / Usage
================

May need to update to edge Rails (using Rails 2.3.1 as of this writing)
1. gem install rails --source http://gems.rubyonrails.org
2. setup database.yml as needed (look at config/database.yml.example if you need help)
3. rake db:create
4. rake db:migrate

Other Notes
================

On some Mac Os X systems you're going to need to define the imagemagick path, on my Leopard box w/ Macports I used the following:
Paperclip.options[:image_magick_path] = '/opt/local/bin'
